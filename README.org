This is the source of a one-page plain HTML table [[https://sergeyqz.github.io/jcheatsheet/][cheatsheet for J language]] with all its primitives (horizontally aligned on the same column for easier visual search), short descriptions with synonyms, and links to NuVoc.

I started learning J language in April 2021. I read the [[https://www.jsoftware.com/help/learning/contents.htm][Learning J]] book, [[https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc][NuVoc]] pages, some essays and various blog posts. My primary use case was to solve algorithmic problems on Android phone. But I found out that NuVoc, unlike J language itself, was not mobile-friendly. I needed a linear table so it's easy to scroll and find a necessary row without entering the symbols into the search field. It was worth to read through all NuVoc pages anyway, and to make learning more active, I compiled the table, and it definetely helped me to solve some Project Euler and Advent of Code problems last year.

There's still much work to do (I'm sure there are mistakes), but I find the table useful as it is right now, so I decided to share it.

Contributions are welcome, but please note, that the ~data.tsv~ file is not the original source of the table. The real table is on Google Sheets (which was not perfect, but I couldn't find a better alternative). So if you want to update the table, just [[https://github.com/sergeyqz/jcheatsheet/issues/new/choose][file an issue]], describe the change and I'll update it myself.
